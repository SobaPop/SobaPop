- 👋 Hi, I’m @SobaPop
- 👀 I’m interested in anything tech related but especially machine learning, robotics, and physics simulations
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Machine Learning
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... (I honestly don't know yet as I'm just attempting to accumulate information and knowledge)
- 📫 How to reach me ... (I'll put an email here eventually but I'm don't consistantly check them nor am I on any socials enough to be easily reachable as of right now)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Her/They
- ⚡ Fun fact: Recent findings indicate that sediment accumulation on biological material at the bottom of the ocean forms very simplistic forms of a battery which perform electrolysis on the ocean water subsequently increasing oxygen levels deep beneath the surface and helping ecosystems flourish
You may have heard of that fun fact in recent news outlets. Except they termed it "Dark Oxygen" which I myself find a rather ammusing name.
